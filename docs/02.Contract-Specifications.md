### Contract Specifications

| Parameter              | What It Means                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Contract Unit**      | The amount of hashrate each contract represents (measured in hashes per second).                                                                                         |
| **Margin Requirement** | The percentage of contract value you must deposit as collateral. This protects both parties if prices move against you. Higher requirements mean more capital locked up. |
| **Expiration Time**    | The time at which the contract expires and is settled. Also the time when delivery starts                                                                                |

### Contract frequency

| Parameter                 | What It Means                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Available Expirations** | How far into the future you can trade. For example, if set to 4 contracts, you can trade up to 4 weeks ahead. |
| **Expiration Interval**   | Interval between two closest delivery dates in days.                                                          |

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Settlement Currency** | The currency used for all payments (e.g., USDC). This is what you deposit as margin and receive during settlement.                                          |
| **Tick Size**           | The smallest price movement allowed. Orders must be placed at prices that are multiples of this step (e.g., if the step is \$0.01, you cant bid at \$0.015) |
| **Tick Value**          | The value of a one-tick move for a single contract.                                                                                                         |
| **Delivery Duration**   | How many days the delivery period lasts. During this time, sellers must deliver hashrate and buyers receive mining rewards.                                 |
