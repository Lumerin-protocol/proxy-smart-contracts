Margin.md

Margin is the amount of collateral that is required to be deposited into the contract to open a position.

There are two types of margin:

- Initial margin
- Effective margin
- Maintenance margin

Initial margin is the amount of collateral that is required to be deposited into the contract to open a position at the current market price.
It is calculated as the product of the entry price per day, quantity, delivery duration, and margin percent.

Effective margin is the initial margin +/- unrealized PnL. It is an actual exposure of the participant to the contract considering profit or loss from the position.

Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of effective margin to avoid a margin call.
