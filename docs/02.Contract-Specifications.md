## Understanding Contract Specifications

These are the key values that define how each futures contract works. You'll see these values displayed in the trading interface.

### Contract Settings

| Parameter               | What It Means                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contract Hashrate**   | The amount of hashrate each contract represents (measured in hashes per second). Larger contracts mean bigger positions and higher margin requirements.     |
| **Delivery Duration**   | How long hashrate delivery happens in days                                                                                                                  |
| **Settlement Currency** | The currency used for all payments (e.g., USDC). This is what you deposit as margin and receive during settlement.                                          |
| **Minimum Price Step**  | The smallest price movement allowed. Orders must be placed at prices that are multiples of this step (e.g., if the step is \$0.01, you cant bid at \$0.015) |
| **Delivery Length**     | How many days the delivery period lasts. During this time, sellers must deliver hashrate and buyers receive mining rewards.                                 |
| **Contract Frequency**  | How often new delivery dates become available (e.g., weekly or monthly).                                                                                    |
| **Trading Horizon**     | How far into the future you can trade. For example, if set to 4 weekly contracts, you can trade up to 4 weeks ahead.                                        |

### Fees & Penalties

| Parameter              | What It Means                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Margin Requirement** | The percentage of contract value you must deposit as collateral. This protects both parties if prices move against you. Higher requirements mean more capital locked up.           |
| **Order Fee**          | A small fee charged by marketplace when you place an order.                                                                                                                        |
| **Breach Penalty**     | If a seller fails to deliver hashrate, they're charged a daily penalty (up to 5% per day). This compensates buyers for non-delivery and incentivizes sellers to fulfill contracts. |

### Trading Limits

| Limit               | What It Means                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Max Open Orders** | The maximum number of orders you can have open at once (typically 100). This is a temporary limitation. |
